          <p>Kaneki had all the same features he has now as an adult with black hair. As a normal university student, Kaneki was a somewhat short and scrawny young man with little to no athletic background and preferred to read books. After the steel beam incident, Kaneki bears a scar from the transplant operation on the right side of his abdomen not far from his navel</p>

          <p>Touka is a slender and attractive teenage girl with bob-length black hair that has long bangs that reach her chin covering the right side of her face and blue eyes. She appears to be a cute, normal girl that one would not suspect to be a ghoul. Her facial features and hairstyle bear a strong resemblance to Hikari Kirishima and Ayato Kirishima. She wears her waitress or high school uniform for work and school respectively, whereas her casual clothes are tomboyish streetwear.</p>
